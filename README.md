Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement Research

This project aims to utilize reinforcement learning methods to teach an agent to play
retro games. It utilizes gym-retro as the environment to do so. 

There are many games which are already integrated for the environment. However, one of the games that 
is most interesting to attempt to integrate is PunchOut (c) or Mike Tysons Punchout (c). An attempt will be
made through observation of the variables while playing the game on a special platform to get information
necessary to build an interface as prescribed in the gym-retro documentation.
