# gymRetro
Reinforcement Learning Research

This project aims to utilize reinforcement learning methods to teach an agent to play
retro games. It utilizes gym-retro as the environment to do so. 

There are many games which are already integrated for the environment. However, one of the games that 
is most interesting to attempt to integrate is PunchOut (c) or Mike Tysons Punchout (c). An attempt will be
made through observation of the variables while playing the game on a special platform to get information
necessary to build an interface as prescribed in the gym-retro documentation.

Variables will be documented along the way, as well as integration material for the environment. 

Integration Useage:
If using Anaconda, the data must be placed in the /Anaconda3/envs/environment_name/Lib/site-packages/retro/data/contrib/MikeTysonsPunchOut-Nes folder.
If you have a different installation, you must find the data folder and contrib sub folder.
My installation is in C:\Users\user_name\Anaconda3\envs\gym-retro\Lib\site-packages\retro\data on Windows 10 using Anaconda.
gym-retro is the name of my environment.

The rom is not included, and must match the sha of the rom sha file included.
